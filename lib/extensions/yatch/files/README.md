Yet Another Text Converter in HTML (YATCH)
=====

YATCH is an HTML document that can convert plaintext to
and from reversed text, Base64, 8 rounds of Base64, and Goomy Clicker
save files. I originally made it to convert Base64, but then decided
to add some more functionality to it, and ended up with this. It's
kind of sloppy, and the layout is nothing to write home about, but
it is functional. YATCH does not work in Internet Explorer 9 and
below, so don't try it.
