nimbus
======

Nimbus is a simple, somewhat hacky Web browser coded in Python 3 and based
around the PyQt4 libraries. It has most of the basic features expected from a
modern browser, including tabbed browsing, history, incognito (private
browsing) tabs, ad blocking, and support for basic extensions.

Dependencies
======

Nimbus depends on Python 3, PyQt4, and python3-dbus. It does not work in
Python 2.x.

You can install its dependencies on Ubuntu using the following command:
    sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pyqt4 python3-dbus python3-dbus.mainloop.qt
